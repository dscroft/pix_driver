# pix_driver
Based on the original ROS pix_driver code.

Intended to be a drop in replacement to the original pix_driver
- With additional safety checks
- New nodes with clearer control messages
- Access to more of the vehicle info
- Using ROS units (i.e. radians)

Work in progress, in particular
- Status messages are not all using the correct units.
